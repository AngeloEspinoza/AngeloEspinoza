## Hi <img src="/assets/hi.gif" width="29px">, I'm Angelo

I'm a grad student at CIMAT, Computational Robotics Engineer, and robotics enthusiast.  I like to give "life" to machines, anything related to: 
Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. I'm always willing to learn something new and opened to be taught. I firmly believe that thoughts 
are like a toolbox and every time you learn something new you have a new tool to build something better.
